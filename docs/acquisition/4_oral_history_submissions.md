### Project Overview and Aim

*Example by Carmen Hendershott*

The New School Oral History Interview Project, undertaken by New School librarian Carmen Hendershott for the New School Archives beginning in the summer of 2012, aims to supplement the often-incomplete written institutional records of the New School by recording the oral reminiscences of members of the New School community, especially longtime faculty, staff, and administrators. In this way, accounts of histories of positions, departments, divisions, institutes and centers, and memorable persons of the New School will be documented, preserved and made available to the public.

*Example from the Brooklyn Historical Society*

Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation. 2007 marked the 40th anniversary of the Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, the oldest community development corporation (CDC) in the United States, founded in 1967 through the efforts of Senator Robert F. Kennedy and Jacob Javits.  Founding Board members, supporters, activists, artists, tenants, and other community members, over 50 narrators total, were interviewed to document Restoration’s pioneering work. 

*Example from The New School Archives*

This project consists of nine interviews undertaken in preparation for the exhibition, Radical Shifts: Reshaping the Interior at Parsons, 1955-1985. The exhibition ran from March 23 to April 8, 2011 in the Arnold and Sheila Aronson Galleries of the Sheila C. Johnson Design Center, Parsons The New School for Design, 66 Fifth Avenue in New York City. The interviews were conducted by Joanna Merwood-Salisbury, professor of architectural history and an administrator in Parsons The New School for Design's School of Constructed Environments; and by Wendy Scheir, director of the Kellen Design Archives at Parsons.

### Biographical Note (interviewee)

*Examples from The New School Archives*

Stanley Barrows (1914-1995) was born in Texas, and graduated from Washington and Lee University before studying at Parsons School of Design. Following his graduation from Parsons, he took a brief job with Joseph Platt as a design associate. After military service in Italy during World War Two as a draughtsman, Barrows returned to Parsons in 1946 to join the Interior Design Department, leading the school’s renowned summer trips to Europe. He left Parsons in 1968 to serve as chairman of the Interior Design Department at the Fashion Institute of Technology. After his retirement in 1985, he became an occasional contributor to Architectural Digest.

Suzanne Cole was an instructor of fashion illustration for ten years before becoming the chair of the Department of Illustration at Parsons School of Design for thirteen years. She began to teaching circa 1959 and retired in approximately 1982.

### Autobiographical Note

Same as above, except you're writing about yourself instead of your interviewee—refer to yourself in the third person, as though someone else is writing about you.

### Summary of Interview

*Example from the Kellen Design Archives*

In this two-part interview conducted by Jenny Swadosh, associate archivist of the New School Archives & Special Collections, in October 2010 and January 2011, Melvin Dwork discusses his choice to study design at Parsons School of Design in the 1940s and his subsequent 50 year career as an interior designer in New York City. Dwork also describes his experiences as a gay man in military service during World War II, and the personal intervention of Van Day Truex, Parsons president in the 1940s, to enable Dwork's return to Parsons after being classified as an "undesirable" by the U.S. Navy and thus ineligibile for the G.I. Bill.

*Example from CalTech Archives*

An interview in two sessions in April 1994 with Clarence R. Allen. In this interview, he discusses growing up in Southern California; his early interest in science and the outdoors; and his wartime career as a navigator in the Army Air Corps. He recalls his years as a Caltech graduate student and his thesis work on the San Andreas fault; his work on glaciology with Robert P. Sharp; his growing interest in seismology; and his work with Charles Richter, Hugo Benioff, and Beno Gutenberg in Caltechís Seismological Laboratory. He discusses the interplay at the Seismo Lab in the 1950s between Richter and Gutenberg; the changes wrought by the advent of Frank Press as director in 1957; and the work of Kerry Sieh in paleoseismology. Praise for the division chairmanship (1952-1968) of Robert Sharp.

*Examples from the Oral Histories of the American South project*

Throughout, he discusses the legal and political measures taken to ameliorate housing conditions for low-income tenants and to ensure that low-income people have access to social welfare services.
