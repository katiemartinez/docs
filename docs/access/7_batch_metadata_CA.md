title: Create Batch Metadata 
---

*Note:   
Batch Imports only occur when more than 10 digital files need to be uploaded to Collective Access.*

## Overview

There are two templates to use for importing data when batch creating new records. 
 - Standard Template: Batch_Upload_Template.xls
 - Thesis Template: Batch_Upload_Thesis_Mapping_Template.xls

Location: Central_Kellen_Share/DigitalArchives/Digital_CollectiveAccess/Import/Batch_Upload_Template.xls

## Creating Metadata
### Step 1: Prepare a metadata spreadsheet for Scan Tech to use while digitizing material
At minimum, the supervisory archivist will complete the following field for Scan Tech before they begin digitizing material: 

   * **[Collection]**   

Format:  
Use collection or series identifier.  

Example:  
Institute for Retired Professionals collection would be: NS022101
Report of the Commission on Older Students at the New School for Social Research series would be:  NS022101_000006

### Step 2: Scan Tech completes fields while scanning
In the interest of quality control, descriptive metadata should be created by a worker other than the Scan Tech. The only fields to be completed by the Scan Tech while digitizing will be: 

 * **[Media Filename]**  

Format:  
The filename is derived from the resource identifier created in Archivists’ Toolkit (Resources > Series > Resource Identifier). 

Example:  
Sample Resource Identifier: NS.03.01.05  
Sample Filename: NS030105_000173 (000173 scan number)

Multi-page documents will have pages added with an underscore:   
Sample Filename: NS030105_000173_pg01  
Sample Filename: NS030105_000173_pg02  

 * **[box #, folder #]** (if applicable)  
 
 Format/Example: 
 box 5, folder 24

### Step 3. Quality Assurance
While completing the batch upload spreadsheet, Scan Tech should simultaneously check accuracy and quality of files (scans). 

QA Checklist:   
1. Review that all pages are present 
2. Confirm whether any images are missing data
3. Check that pages do not need to be rotated, etc.

### Step 4. Supervisory archivist completes metadata
The final fields to be completed are as follows:
